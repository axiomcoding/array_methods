# Array Methods
Apply various Ruby array methods to pass each RSpec test. 

##### Note: Each array is defined in the RSpec file meaning you do not need to define any arrays in the `array_methods.rb` file.
##### Please see the [Ruby Array Documentation](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Array.html) for reference.
